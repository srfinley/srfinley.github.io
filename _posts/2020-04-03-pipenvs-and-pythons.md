Pipenvs and Pythons is a classic-style adventure game that randomly generates a new maze for each player to solve. The back end was built by a team of four volunteers a week and uses Django with a Graphene GraphQL API for gameplay.

Although the front end was not completed, the back end github repository is public and I'm very proud of the work that's been put into it.
