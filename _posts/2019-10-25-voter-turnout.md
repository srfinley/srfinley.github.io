A web app made with Plotly Dash that presents a predictive model of voter turnout built on real-world data.

The centerpiece of the app is the "Predictions" page, where users can directly interact with the embedded model by adjusting input parameters and seeing how each one affects the predicted likelihood of voting. Other pages go into more depth about the process of cleaning the data and building, refining, and interpreting the model.
