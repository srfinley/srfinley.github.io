Twitoff is a Flask app with an integrated user-editable Postgres database that uses a simple NLP model to predict which of two Twitter accounts is more likely to tweet a given statement.

Twitoff uses the Twitter API to gather the recent original tweets of any specified public user and embeds the text with Basilica. Users can add accounts to the database in order to make comparisons between any of them.

[Check it out here.](https://srfinley-twitoff.herokuapp.com/) Be aware that the app "sleeps" -- if it's been a while since anyone looked at it, it might take a while to load in the browser. Accounts loaded into the database persist between sessions unless removed with the "Refresh Database" button.
